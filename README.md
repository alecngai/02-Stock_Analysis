# 02 - Stock Analysis by Alec Ngai

## Overview of Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our client Steve and his parents wish to have a workbook in which they can analyze the entire stock market over the last few years with a click of a button. To achieve this we must refactor our code, this is key to analyze a large dataset with compilation time. We are given a dataset in which we named ***"VBA_Challenge.xlsm"*** this dataset contains of two sheets categorized by the year **2017** and **2018**. Within both sheets there consists of 8 columns: 

**Ticker**:  This ticker assigns this row of data to stock, with a two-letter combination to identify the stock.  \
**Date**: When the row of data was collected \
**Open**: Price at which the stock openned at in the market \
**High**: Highest price the stock sold for during that day the market was open \
**Low**: Lowest price the stock sold for during that day the market was open \
**Close**: Closing price of the stock when the stock market closed \
**Adj Close**: The **adjusted closing** price amends a stock's **closing** price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. \
**Volume**: The amount of stocks exchanged during the market open \
